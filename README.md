## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and enhancing website performance using key performance indicators (KPIs) and user interaction data. It involves understanding performance metrics, identifying bottlenecks, optimizing website performance, improving user experience, and predicting future trends.

## Project Goals

* **Understand Performance Metrics:** Examine metrics like page load time, time to first byte (TTFB), bounce rate, and session duration to understand their correlation with user behavior and website success.
* **Identify Bottlenecks:** Detect issues such as slow-loading pages, unoptimized media files, inefficient code, and poor server response times, assessing their impact on user engagement.
* **Optimize Website Performance:** Implement strategies like caching, minifying resources, using content delivery networks (CDNs), or improving server configurations to enhance performance.
* **Improve User Experience (UX):** Create faster, more responsive, and accessible websites to improve user satisfaction and provide actionable insights for improved navigation and design.
* **Future Trend Prediction:** Use historical data to forecast traffic spikes and ensure consistent functionality under peak loads, proposing solutions for scalability and reliability.

## Data Source

The project uses the `traffic.csv` file as its primary data source. This file contains website traffic data, including dates and the number of visits.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:** The `traffic.csv` file is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Missing values are handled using imputation techniques, outliers are addressed, and data types are validated.
2. **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis are performed to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
3. **Data Visualization:** Line plots, histograms, and box plots are used to visualize website traffic trends and distributions, providing insights into potential bottlenecks.
4. **Feature Engineering:** New features such as 'DayOfWeek', 'Month', 'VisitCategory', and 'RollingAvgVisits' are created to improve predictive model performance.
5. **Data Splitting:** The engineered data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
6. **Model Training:** A time series forecasting model (Prophet) is trained using the training data.
7. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset using metrics like RMSE and MAE.
8. **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the Prophet model's forecasting accuracy.
9. **Prediction Visualization:** The optimized model's predictions are visualized against the actual website traffic to assess its performance.

## Results

* The optimized Prophet model achieved an RMSE of approximately 1069.79 and an MAE of 879.81 on the test dataset.
* The best hyperparameter combination during optimization was `seasonality_mode='multiplicative'`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to website traffic analysis and performance optimization. The insights gained from the analysis and the predictive capabilities of the optimized model can be used to make informed decisions about website improvements and resource allocation.

## Future Work

* Investigate external factors influencing website traffic.
* Explore alternative time series models or incorporate external factors into the model for improved forecasting accuracy.
